<!--
CDATA in HTML is no longer allowed.
It will be parsed like a declaration (`<!content>`, just like
the doctype), which means `>`s will break out of them.
Then, it’ll result in a comment.

CDATA in foreign contet is allowed, but is also “garbled”.

<p>You can add a string to a number, but this stringifies the number:</p>
<math>
 <ms><![CDATA[x<y]]></ms>
 <mo>+</mo>
 <mn>3</mn>
 <mo>=</mo>
 <ms><![CDATA[x>y3]]></ms>
</math>
