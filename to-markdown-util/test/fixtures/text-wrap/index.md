# Text Wrap

HTML is a insensitive to whitespace, whereas Markdown *is* sensitive.
In some Markdown elements, it’s not possible to include line breaks (whether CR,
LF, or CR+LF).
To handle this, we need to remove them in certain scenario’s: headings and table
cells.

Line breaks can be created in several ways, such as `br` elements:

# break in h1

## break in h2

### break in h3

#### break in h4

##### break in h5

###### break in h6

| Heading cell |
| ------------ |
| Data cell    |

In `newlines: true` mode, line feeds such as this one:
would normally also produce an line feed:

# break in h1

## break in h2

### break in h3

#### break in h4

##### break in h5

###### break in h6

| Heading cell |
| ------------ |
| Data cell    |
