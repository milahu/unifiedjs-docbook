<h1>Text Wrap</h1>

<p>HTML is a insensitive to whitespace, whereas Markdown <em>is</em> sensitive.
In some Markdown elements, it’s not possible to include line breaks (whether CR,
LF, or CR+LF).
To handle this, we need to remove them in certain scenario’s: headings and table
cells.

<p>Line breaks can be created in several ways, such as <code>br</code> elements:
<h1>break<br>in h1</h1>
<h2>break<br>in h2</h2>
<h3>break<br>in h3</h3>
<h4>break<br>in h4</h4>
<h5>break<br>in h5</h5>
<h6>break<br>in h6</h6>
<table>
  <tr><th>Heading<br>cell
  <tr><td>Data<br>cell
</table>

<p>In <code>newlines: true</code> mode, line feeds such as this one:
would normally also produce an line feed:
<h1>break
in h1</h1>
<h2>break
in h2</h2>
<h3>break
in h3</h3>
<h4>break
in h4</h4>
<h5>break
in h5</h5>
<h6>break
in h6</h6>
<table>
  <tr><th>Heading
cell
  <tr><td>Data
cell
</table>
